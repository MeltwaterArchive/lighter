{"name":"Lighter","tagline":"Marathon deployment automation tool","body":"# Lighter\r\n[![Travis CI](https://img.shields.io/travis/meltwater/lighter/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/meltwater/lighter)\r\n[![Coverage Status](https://codecov.io/github/meltwater/lighter/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/meltwater/lighter?branch=master&view=all)\r\n\r\n[Lighter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighter_(barge)) solves the problem of automating\r\ndeployments to [Marathon](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon) and handling of differences\r\nbetween multiple environments. Given a hierachy of yaml files and environments, Lighter can\r\nexpand service config files and deploy them to Marathon.\r\n\r\nFor even tighter integration into the development process, Lighter can resolve Marathon config files\r\nfrom Maven and merge these with environment specific overrides. This enables continuous deployment\r\nwhenever new releases or snapshots appear in the Maven repository. Optional version range constraints\r\nallows patches/minor versions to be rolled out continuously, while requiring a config change to roll\r\nout major versions.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
